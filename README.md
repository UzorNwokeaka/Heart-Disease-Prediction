The hospital has several specialized clinics, including adiabetes clinic, a fertility clinic, a heart clinic, and a cancerclinic. It also offers services such as health check-ups, laboratory tests, and imaging services.

**Objective:**

Build a heart disease prediction machine learning model which accurately predicts the likelihood of a person having a heart disease based on certain features.

**Data Dictionary:**

The heart CSV dataset contains 303 records and 14 columns, including the target variable. The features include age, sex, chest pain type (cp), resting blood pressure (trestbps), serum cholesterol (chol), fasting blood sugar (fbs), resting electrocardiographic results (restecg),
maximum heart rate achieved (thalach), exercise-induced angina (exang), ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (oldpeak), the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (slope), number of major vessels colored by flourosopy (ca), and thalassemia (thal.
